5)BudgetBites is a meal-planning web app designed specifically for college students who want to eat well without draining their wallet. 
The app helps users generate weekly meal plans and grocery lists that prioritize low-cost ingredients, simple recipes, and minimal cooking equipment for dorm kitchens or shared student apartments. Users can input dietary restrictions, food preferences, cook time preferences and a weekly budget, and BudgetBites will match them with affordable recipes and meal plans optimized for cost and convenience.
Instead of relying on random TikTok recipes or expensive delivery apps, BudgetBites provides structure, predictability, and real savings. It takes the stress out of figuring out what to eat, helps users avoid impulsive takeout spending, and encourages healthier and cheaper eating habits over time.
